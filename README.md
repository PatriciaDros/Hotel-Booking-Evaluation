## My Journey
Hi, I’m Patricia Dros, a New York-based data analyst who recently transitioned from operations to analytics, and I’m thrilled to share my capstone project from the Springboard Data Analytics Bootcamp (completed April 2023). This project, *Hotel Booking Evaluation*, was the culmination of months of learning, growth, and pure joy in discovering the power of data. As someone who spent years in project support and education, diving into this bootcamp was a leap of faith—but creating this project was the moment I knew I’d found my calling: analyzing data, telling stories, and finding order from the chaos (my tagline!).

I had an absolute blast working on this capstone. From cleaning messy datasets to crafting visualizations in Tableau, every step was a thrilling puzzle. I loved uncovering hidden patterns, connecting the dots, and turning raw numbers into actionable stories for hotel management. This project wasn’t just a requirement—it was a celebration of my new skills and a confirmation that data analysis is exactly what I’m meant to do.

## The Project
This capstone project analyzes hotel booking data from the [Hotel Booking Demand dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtaba142/hotel-booking) to reveal customer preferences, evaluate the impact of online bookings and cancellations on revenue, and address data quality issues. Using Python, Excel, and Tableau, I explored the dataset, built interactive visualizations, and delivered actionable recommendations to improve hotel operations. The process was exhilarating—each insight felt like a small victory, and I couldn’t wait to share my findings.

### What I Did
I dove into this dataset with enthusiasm, using:
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**: To clean and transform the messy data—turning chaos into structure was so satisfying!
- **Excel**: For initial exploration, which helped me get a feel for the data.
- **Tableau**: To create an interactive story that brought my insights to life.

I focused on three key areas:
- **Customer Preferences**: Discovering what guests value most (room accommodation and cuisine) and profiling their preferences.
- **Revenue Impact**: Analyzing how online bookings and cancellations affect revenue, especially with "No Deposit" policies.
- **Data Quality**: Identifying errors that skew results, which fueled my passion for clean, reliable data.

### Insights from My Tableau Story
Creating the [Hotel Booking Evaluation Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/patricia.dros/viz/HotelBookingEvaluation/Story1) was one of the most fun parts! I loved designing visuals that told a clear story. Here’s what I found:
- **Customer Preferences**: Most guests opt for Bed & Breakfast packages, and Online Travel Agents dominate bookings. Families prefer Resort Hotels.
- **Cancellation Rates**: 37% of bookings are canceled, with "No Deposit" bookings canceling over 50% of the time—especially close to arrival.
- **Revenue Loss**: Cancellations cause a 20% revenue loss during peak seasons, driven by last-minute cancellations and room mismatches.
- **Room Issues**: Mismatches between reserved and assigned rooms increase cancellations, signaling guest dissatisfaction.

Each visualization felt like a mini-revelation, and I couldn’t wait to dig deeper!

## My Recommendations
I had a blast brainstorming solutions to help hotels thrive. Here’s what I recommend:

### Monetizing Cancellations
- **Require Deposits**: Eliminate the "No Deposit" option to reduce no-shows.
- **Room Upgrades**: Offer checked-in guests upgrades for a small fee when cancellations free up better rooms.
- **Penalty Fees**: Charge higher fees for late cancellations to incentivize commitment.
- **Social Media Blitz**: Promote last-minute deals on canceled rooms to local groups, offering unbeatable prices.

### Boosting Online Bookings
- **Online Discounts**: Offer savings for direct bookings to cut agent fees.
- **Rewards Program**: Create a points system for future bookings, dining, and services.
- **Smart Redirection**: Ensure the hotel app guides users to the booking page.
- **Expand Channels**: Use platforms like Booking.com and Expedia to reach more guests.
- **Social Media Engagement**: Send trip reminders and entertainment updates via social media.

### Operational Improvements
- **Real-Time System**: Use a booking system that validates data to reduce errors.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Set Average Daily Rates based on seasons, holidays, and room types.
- **Repurpose Rooms**: Turn underused rooms into amenities like a game room or late-night bar.
- **Elevate Cuisine**: Hire a Michelin-rated chef, as food is a top guest priority.
- **Faster Confirmations**: Reduce `days_in_waiting_list` to confirm bookings quickly.
- **Guest Profiles**: Track preferences and history for personalized experiences.

## Project Files
- **Code**: Python scripts for cleaning and analysis, plus Excel files for exploration (in this repo).

## Reflection: Finding My Passion

This project was a turning point. Analyzing data, crafting visuals, and making recommendations felt deeply fulfilling. I knew this was my calling—analyzing data, telling stories, and finding order from the chaos. The Springboard bootcamp gave me the tools, and this capstone gave me the confidence to pursue data analysis as my career. I’m eager to bring this passion to my next role and uncover insights that drive impact!
